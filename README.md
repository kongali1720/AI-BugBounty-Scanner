> A next-gen CLI tool that uses AI to scan GitHub repos and websites for vulnerabilities, auto-generates reports, and submits issues. Hunt bugs like a dewa! 🦹‍♂️

## 🚀 What is AI-Powered Bug Bounty Scanner?

**AI-Powered Bug Bounty Scanner** is a tool for bug bounty hunters and security researchers. It combines AI (Grok/CodeBERT) with popular security tools (Bandit, Nuclei) to detect vulnerabilities like XSS, SQLi, and misconfigurations in codebases and web apps. It automates scanning, reporting, and GitHub issue submission, making your bug hunting faster and smarter.

> 💡 Vision: Empower hackers to find critical bugs with AI-driven precision.

## 🧠 Features

- 🕵️‍♂️ **AI-Driven Vulnerability Detection**: Uses Grok/CodeBERT to identify code patterns for bugs like XSS, SQLi, and hard-coded secrets.
- 📝 **Automated Reporting**: Generates Markdown/PDF reports with CVSS scores and remediation advice.
- 🔌 **Plugin System**: Extendable with custom plugins for specific vulnerabilities (e.g., JWT, SSRF).
- 🐙 **GitHub Integration**: Scans repos and auto-submits issues for critical findings.
- 📊 **X API Validation**: Cross-checks findings with X posts for community validation.
- ⚡ **Multi-Agent Scanning**: Parallel scanning for speed and efficiency.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **AI**: Groq API or CodeBERT
- **Security Tools**: Bandit, Nuclei, Trivy
- **APIs**: GitHub API, X API
- **Storage**: Local (Markdown/PDF) or IPFS (optional)
- **Dependencies**: `requests`, `aiohttp`, `numpy`, `PyPDF2`

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- GitHub API token
- Groq API key (optional for AI)
- VPS for scheduled scans (optional)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kongali1720/AI-BugBounty-Scanner.git
cd AI-BugBounty-Scanner
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration
1. Set environment variables in `.env`:
   ```
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   X_API_KEY=your_x_api_key
   ```
2. Edit `plugin_config.yaml` for custom scans:
   ```yaml
   xss_scanner:
     enabled: true
     options:
       timeout: 30
       max_depth: 3
   ```

### Run Scanner
